Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)        ->  Is an easy to use, high-performance, block-storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
                                            When using EBS Volumes, the volume and the instance must be in the same Availability Zone
                                            EBS volume is off-instance storage that can persist independently from the life of an instance
                                            EBS Volumes can be mounted to one instance at a time. It is also possible that an EBS Volume is not mounted to an instance
                                            The fundamental charges for EBS volumes are:    the volume type (based on performance), 
                                                                                            the storage volume in GB per month provisioned, 
                                                                                            the number of IOPS provisioned per month, 
                                                                                            the storage consumed by snapshots, 
                                                                                            and outbound data transfer
                                            The EC2 instance type the EBS volume is attached to does not influence the EBS volume pricing
Amazon Instance Store                   ->  An Instance Store provides temporary block-level storage for your EC2 instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. 
                                            Instance store is ideal for the temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for 
                                            data that is replicated across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers. Instance storage is temporary, data is lost if instance experiences 
                                            failure or is terminated
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)      ->  Is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance

                                                Classes which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs), S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ and costs 
                                                20% less than S3 Standard-IA. S3 One Zone-IA is ideal for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data 
                                                but do not require the availability and resilience of S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA. It’s a good choice for storing secondary backup 
                                                copies of on-premises data or easily re-creatable data.

                                                    ->Abide by data sovreignity laws 
                                                S3 Versioning -> Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore 
                                                every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket
                                                S3 Access Logs -> Server access logging provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket
                                            As S3 is object-based storage, so it cannot be used for file sharing between instances

Amazon Machine Image                    ->  An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances 
                                            from a single AMI when you need multiple instances with the same configuration.
                                            You must use an AMI from the same region as that of the EC2 instance. The region of the AMI has no bearing on the performance of the EC2 instance
                                            An AMI includes the following:
                                                ->  One or more EBS snapshots, or, for instance-store-backed AMIs, a template for the root volume of the instance (for example, an operating system, an application server, 
                                                    and applications).
                                                ->  Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.
                                                ->  A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched.
EBS Snapshots                           ->  An EBS snapshot is a point-in-time copy of your Amazon EBS volume. EBS snapshots are one of the components of an AMI, but EBS snapshots alone cannot be used to deploy the same 
                                            EC2 instances across different Availability Zones (AZs)
                                            You can back up the data on your Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon S3 by taking point-in-time snapshots
AWS Cloud Development Kit               ->  The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages

                                            NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
VPC Peering                             ->  A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. 
                                            It is used to connect VPCs together, and not on-premises data centers and AWS Cloud
                                            VPC peering is not transitive, a separate VPC peering connection has to be made between two VPCs that need to talk to each other. With growing VPCs, this gets difficult to manage
                                            In such usecases, its better to use AWS Transit Gateway
Network ACL                             ->  A Network Access Control List (NACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets 
                                            (i.e. it works at subnet level). A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic.
                                            Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default network ACL. By default, it allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and, if applicable, IPv6 traffic.
                                            You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.
                                            Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatically associated 
                                            with the default network ACL.
                                            You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets. However, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time. When you associate a network ACL with a subnet, 
                                            the previous association is removed.
                                            A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules. We evaluate the rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, to determine whether traffic is allowed in or out of 
                                            any subnet associated with the network ACL. The highest number that you can use for a rule is 32766. We recommend that you start by creating rules in increments 
                                            (for example, increments of 10 or 100) so that you can insert new rules where you need to later on.
                                            A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic.
                                            Network ACLs are stateless, which means that responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbound traffic (and vice versa)
VPC Flow Logs                           ->  VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data can be published to 
                                            Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3
IAM access advisor                      ->  Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed. You can use this information to revise your policies. To summarize, 
                                            you can identify unnecessary permissions so that you can revise your IAM policies accordingly.

                                            EC2 Instance Connect can be used to connect to an EC2 instance from a Mac OS, Windows or Linux based computer
VPC Interface Endpoint                  ->  An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address from the IP address range of your subnet that serves as an entry point for traffic destined 
                                            to a supported service. Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access services by using private IP addresses. 
                                            AWS PrivateLink restricts all network traffic between your VPC and services to the Amazon network. You do not need an internet gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway
VPC Gateway Endpoint                    ->  A Gateway Endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic destined to a supported AWS service. The following AWS services
