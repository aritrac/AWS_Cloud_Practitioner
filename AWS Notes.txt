    such as the key ID, creation date, description, and key state. The CMK also contains the key material used to encrypt and decrypt data

->  Customer managed CMKs are CMKs in your AWS account that you create, own, and manage. You have full control over these CMKs, including establishing and maintaining 
    their key policies, IAM policies, and grants, enabling and disabling them, rotating their cryptographic material, adding tags, creating aliases that refer to the CMK, 
    and scheduling the CMKs for deletion
    A customer master key (CMK) is a logical representation of a master key. The CMK includes metadata, such as the key ID, creation date, description, and key state. 
    The CMK also contains the key material used to encrypt and decrypt data. These are created and managed by the AWS customer. Access to these can be controlled using the AWS IAM service.

->  AWS Managed CMK - AWS managed CMKs are CMKs in your account that are created, managed, and used on your behalf by an AWS service that is integrated with AWS KMS.

->  An availability zone is one or more data centers in the same location.

->  Service control policies (SCPs) are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. 
    SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization. SCPs help you to ensure your accounts stay within your organization’s 
    access control guidelines.
    SCPs alone are not sufficient to grant permissions to the accounts in your organization. No permissions are granted by an SCP. An SCP defines a guardrail, or sets limits, 
    on the actions that the account's administrator can delegate to the IAM users and roles in the affected accounts.

    services underlying your AWS resources

->  Data transfer-in is always free, including for EBS volumes

-> PaaS ->  PaaS removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. 
            You don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your 
            application

-> IaaS ->  IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. 
            IaaS gives the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources

-> SaaS ->  SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or 
            how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software

-> AWS Support Plans Summary
    ->  Business:   AWS recommends Business Support if you have production workloads on AWS and want 24x7 phone, email and chat access to technical support and architectural guidance in the context 
                    of your specific use-cases. You get full access to AWS Trusted Advisor Best Practice Checks. It is also the cheapeast support plan to provide enhanced technical support by Cloud 
                    Support Engineers.
                    You get full access to AWS Trusted Advisor Best Practice Checks
    ->  Developer:  It provides enhanced technical support, but by Cloud Support Associates.
                    AWS recommends Developer Support if you are testing or doing early development on AWS and want the ability to get email-based technical support during business hours as well as 
                    general architectural guidance as you build and test. You do not get access to Infrastructure Event Management with this plan
                    AWS Developer Support plan allows one primary contact to open unlimited cases
    ->  Basic:      A basic support plan is included for all AWS customers. It does not provide enhanced technical support.
                    Customer Service & Communities - 24x7 access to customer service, documentation, whitepapers, and support forums. 
                    AWS Trusted Advisor - Access to the 7 core Trusted Advisor checks and guidance to provision your resources following best practices to increase performance and improve security. 
                    AWS Personal Health Dashboard - A personalized view of the health of AWS services, and alerts when your resources are impacted
    ->  Enterprise: AWS Enterprise Support provides customers with concierge-like service where the main focus is helping the customer achieve their outcomes and find success in the cloud.
                    With Enterprise Support, you get 24x7 technical support from high-quality engineers, tools and technology to automatically manage the health of your environment, 
                    consultative architectural guidance delivered in the context of your applications and use-cases, and a designated Technical Account Manager (TAM) to coordinate access 
                    to proactive/preventative programs and AWS subject matter experts. It provides enhanced technical support by Cloud Support Engineers, but is more expensive than the 
                    Business support plan.
                    This plan guarantees a case response time of 15 minutes when Business Critical systems are down
                        General Guidance - < 24 hours
                        System Impaired - < 12 hours
                        Production System Impaired - < 4 hours

                    Enterprise Support, you get access to online training with self-paced labs
                    provides access to Infrastructure Event Management for an additional fee
    ->  AWS Personal Health Dashboard is available across all support plans

-> Best practices for AWS account root user: 
        -> Enable MFA for the AWS account root user.
        -> Set up an IAM user with administrator permissions and do not use AWS account root user for administrative tasks
        -> AWS recommends that if you do have an access key for your AWS account root user
        -> You cannot reduce the permissions associated with your AWS account root user access key, therefore You should never share these access keys with any other users, not even the administrators

-> Amazon EC2 Spot Instances let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud. Spot Instances are available at up to a 90% discount compared to On-Demand prices
   It can be used to run any containerized workload with Elastic Container Service (ECS) that can be interrupted 
   Containers are stateless, fault-tolerant and a great fit for Spot Instances 
   Spot instance capacity allocated to you can be taken back anytime without notice if AWS needs them. Hence, Spot instances can only be used as additional compute capacity and 
   not for hosting or installing any software or database.
   Business-critical workloads cannot be run on Spot instances. 
   For a scheduled requirement, Scheduled Reserved instances should be used. 

-> EC2 instance user data is the data that you specified in the form of a bootstrap script or configuration parameters while launching your instance

-> EC2 instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to manage the instance

-> U2F security key: Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) Security Key is a device that you can plug into a USB port on your computer

-> We can use Amazon S3 to host static website. To host a static website on Amazon S3, you configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload your website content to the bucket. 
   When you configure a bucket as a static website, you must enable website hosting, set permissions, and create and add an index document

-> Best practices for AWS IAM 
    Lock away your AWS account root user access keys
    Create individual IAM users
    Use user groups to assign permissions to IAM users
    Grant least privilege
    Get started using permissions with AWS managed policies
    Validate your policies
    Use customer managed policies instead of inline policies
    Use access levels to review IAM permissions
    Configure a strong password policy for your users
    Enable MFA
    Use roles for applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances
    Use roles to delegate permissions
    Do not share access keys
    Rotate credentials regularly
    Remove unnecessary credentials
    Use policy conditions for extra security
    Monitor activity in your AWS account

->  There is no off-the-shelf solution or service that the company can use to facilitate the transition of its IT resources from a region to another region.
    They have to create the resources first in the new region, and then migrate its application and data to the new region.

->  Most of the services that AWS offers are Region specific. But few services, by definition, need to be in a global scope because of the underlying service they offer. 
    AWS IAM, Amazon CloudFront, Route 53 and WAF are some of the global services

->  You will pay a fee each time you read from or write data stored on the EFS - Infrequent Access storage class

->  Amazon EBS Snapshots are stored incrementally, which means you are billed only for the changed blocks stored

->  Structure of AWS Policy:
    Version – Specify the version of the policy language that you want to use. As a best practice, use the latest 2012-10-17 version.
    Statement – Use this main policy element as a container for the following elements. You can include more than one statement in a policy.
        Sid (Optional) – Include an optional statement ID to differentiate between your statements.

        Effect – Use Allow or Deny to indicate whether the policy allows or denies access.

        Principal (Required in only some circumstances) – If you create a resource-based policy, you must indicate the account, user, role, or federated user to which 
        you would like to allow or deny access. If you are creating an IAM permissions policy to attach to a user or role, you cannot include this element. The principal is 
        implied as that user or role.

        Action – Include a list of actions that the policy allows or denies.

        Resource (Required in only some circumstances) – If you create an IAM permissions policy, you must specify a list of resources to which the actions apply. If you 
        create a resource-based policy, this element is optional. If you do not include this element, then the resource to which the action applies is the resource to 
        which the policy is attached.

        Condition (Optional) – Specify the circumstances under which the policy grants permission.

->  Cost Allocation Tags in AWS Billing
    A Cost Allocation Tag is a label that you or AWS assigns to an AWS resource. Each tag consists of a key and a value. For each resource, each tag key must be unique, 
    and each tag key can have only one value. You can use tags to organize your resources, and cost allocation tags to track your AWS costs on a detailed level
    ->  For each resource, each tag key must be unique, and each tag key can have only one value
    ->  You must activate both AWS generated tags and user-defined tags separately before they can appear in Cost Explorer or on a cost allocation report

->  NAT Gateway :   A NAT Gateway or a NAT Instance can be used in a public subnet in your VPC to enable instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the Internet. 
                    NAT Gateway is managed by AWS but NAT Instance is managed by you

->  Internet Gateway :  An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet

->  Just remember that only S3 and DynamoDB support VPC Endpoint Gateway. All other services that support VPC Endpoints use a VPC Endpoint Interface

->  Every AWS account provides its own invoice end of the month. You can get separate invoices for development and production environments by setting up separate AWS accounts for each environment

->  You cannot create separate invoices based on tags.

->  Amazon EFS is a regional service storing data within and across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability and durability. Amazon EC2 instances can access your file system across AZs, 
    regions, and VPCs, while on-premises servers can access using AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN

->  AWS Shield, WAF, and CloudFront with Route 53 help mitigate DDoS attacks

->  A VPC spans all of the Availability Zones in the Region whereas a subnet spans only one Availability Zone in the Region

->  EBS volume can be attached to a single instance in the same Availability Zone whereas EFS file system can be mounted on instances across multiple Availability Zones

->  There is a one-minute minimum charge for Linux based EC2 instances, so this is the correct option

->  Each AWS Region consists of two or more Availability Zones

->  Each Availability Zone (AZ) consists of one or more discrete data centers

->  The AWS account must be able to operate as a standalone account. Only then it can be removed from AWS organizations

->  Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2. An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server 
    fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirements.

->  Partial upfront payment option with standard 3-years term is the most cost effective EC2 reserved instance payment

->  Savings for reserved instances based on payment models:
    "No upfront payment option with the standard 1-year term" - 36%

    "All upfront payment option with the standard 1-year term" - 40%

    "No upfront payment option with the standard 3-years term" - 56%

    "Partial upfront payment option with the standard 3-years term" - 59%

->  There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or data transfer between other 
    AWS services within the same region. Outbound data transfer is aggregated across services and then charged at the outbound data transfer rate.

->  EC2 Instances,DynamoDB and RDS supports reservation to optimize costs.
